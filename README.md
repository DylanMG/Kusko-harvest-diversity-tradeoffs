Posterior samples required to condition the operating model in the closed loop simulations are available upon request from brendan.connors@dfo-mpo.gc.ca and are from analyses described in:

## Files
- `make.R`: All code required to reproduce current set of simulations and figures.

- `load.R`: Loads packages and scripts necessary for analysis. This file should be sourced prior to running other scripts.

- `functions.R`: All functions written for the analysis should be placed in this file.
  
- `close_loop_sims.R`: Run closed loop forwad simulations.

- `figures.R`: Generate figures not associated with simulations (e.g., equilibrium trade-offs, populaiton diversity; in `figures` folder)
  
- `simulation_summary.Rmd`: R Markdown doc that summarizes simulations, and generates figures for manuscript (in `images` folder)

- `appendix_A.R`: R Markdown doc that details the stationary Ricker to time-varying Beverton-Holt formulation we used, and simulations to justify its parameterization in our closed-loop simulations.
